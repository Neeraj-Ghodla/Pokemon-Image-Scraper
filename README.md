# Pokemon-Image-Scraper
Scrape Pokemon Images from Bulbapedia

# Download images from the pre-scraped urls
Run the download.py file to download images from the pre-scraped urls

# Download images by scraping new urls
Run the scrape.py file, It will create files containing the urls of the pokemon. Then run the download.py file to download the images from the newly scraped urls. Depending on the time of scraping you might also need to modify the "gen" list in the donwload.py file to download all the images if any new generation are available.


Note: Delete the generation files before running the scrape.py file.
